Sepotipai is a React app built using Spotify API. This App is made using Typescript, Tailwind css, Redux, React Hooks. It is a simple app that allows you to search for songs, artists, and add your favorites songs to your playlist. This App is made for educational purposes. This app also uses eslint for code quality.
